# Life, The Universe, and Everything
Things that I've just kinda decided to believe over the years that I've been on this Earth

## Preamble
So, I don't know why I'm writing this, except that I feel like I should have written it many years ago. I was at a Skrillex concert for my 27th birthday, and I had this thought, which I texted to myself because my old phone was too crappy to actually take notes and stuff. I can't find exactly what I wrote, but the general idea was that I felt my purpose in life was to write about... well, life. I remember the keywords "chaos", "alan watts", "slavoj žižek", and "george carlin" being in it.

I think what I was trying to tell myself was that I felt like I'd stumbled upon some fundamental Truths, and I've always believed that for me, it's not enough just to "do", I also need to "share". Fast forward over 5 years, and I only recently just started writing on my blog [Remote Curious](https://remotecurious.substack.com/). It has been a rewarding exercise to think of specific topics and try to convey them in a concice but enjoyable way. But in this moment I feel like I need to be doing more. I feel like I am like a mountaineering guide. My passion is to wander all over Life, but up until recently, I've been doing it solo. I was hoping that with my blog, I could take people along with me. But now I feel like I should instead just write about what I've found along the way.

I'm in a condo in Playa del Carmen, Mexico. It's March 20th, 2020 -- the Spring Equinox -- and most of the world is in lockdown. COVID-19, aka the novel coronavirus, has been spreading across the globe. In an effort to stem the pandemic, many countries have closed their borders and are requiring their citizens to be quarantined in their homes. Here in Mexico, it's a different situation. It's been business as usual this entire time. It makes you wonder -- what will it be like when the other shoe drops?

OK, let's just get this out of the way now: I've got some pretty strange beliefs. I have promised myself that I am going to do my best to convey them here. But I don't expect you to understand, let alone agree with, them. If you read something and decide I'm off my rocker, that's your perogative. For myself, though, I've had enough authentic experiences in my life that I know what I believe -- not what I would like to be true, but what I've actually lived through. I'm pretty grateful for that.

So one of the things that I believe is that we have the ability to have premonitions of the future. You can call it whatever you want -- gut instinct, intuition, fifth-dimension higher-self, the Holy Spirit. There's lots of words for it, but I believe they all are talking about the same thing. I'm going to use the word conscience, because I think it has enough context for most people to know what I'm talking about, but not too much context that it becomes a woo-woo word.

A few years ago, I got a tattoo on my left forearm that says "HAZ LO QUE DEBES". When people ask me what it means, I kinda pause for a second to decide how much I want to tell them. To some people I just say that it means "Do the right thing", which is close enough. Literally, it means "Do that which you should", but that last word "deber" has a very special context. There are two other phrases "Haz lo que tienes" and "Haz lo que quieres" which respectively mean "Do what you're told" and "Do what you want". The first is an external motivation from parents, society, authority, etc. The second is an internal motivation, but what Freud would have called the "id" -- our mortal desires, lusts, hungers, urges, etc. I often think of "tienes" and "quieres" as on a spectrum, where often individualistic societies are on the end of "do what you want", and collectivist societies are more on the side of "do what you're told".

But "haz lo que debes" is not on that spectrum. When I picture it, it's in a higher dimension, and therefore apart from the other two. The motivation there doesn't come from outside, nor really from inside -- it comes from our conscience. We've all been in a situation that we feel is "not right". Or on the flip side, where we feel it's "what we should do". This form of motivation and responsibility can be frustratingly difficult to follow. Many times, the things we know are right are not what we want to do, or are not what others are telling us to do. So to "haz lo que debes", we need to often stand up to both ourselves and others and do what we know is right even if it sucks.
